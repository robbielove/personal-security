# Personal Security
How to remain vigilant in a world full of security threats

## Capture Events
- Wear a body camera in public and have it constantly recording to capture any events as needed for evidence to protect yourself.

## Data Security

### Physical Locking
- Lock your data in a safe place to ensure the data is kept integral - not deleted, destroyed, or tampered with. Specifically, use a locked cabinet, server rack, or locked metal drawer.

### Data Encryption
- Keep your data encrypted to prevent access from unauthorized parties.

### Share Less
- Share only what data is needed and maintain vigilance over your personal information so that it is not used by third parties to impersonate you, market to you, or target you. Don't willingly give away personal information.

## Email Security

### Wildcard Email Addresses
- Utilize wildcard email addresses to enable each correspondent or contact to have an address that is personalized to them. This way, you can identify when that specific address has been passed on and possibly sold to a third party or a data breach may have occurred - if you received emails to that address which are not from the original sender. This also enables you to easily dispose of that specific personalized address and leave all other recipient addresses untouched.

## Account Security

### Strong Passwords
- Use strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts. A strong password should be at least 12 characters long, including a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your accounts, which requires you to provide two or more pieces of evidence (such as a password and a one-time code) to confirm your identity.

### Account Recovery Options
- Keep your account recovery options up-to-date, such as alternative email addresses, phone numbers, and security questions, to help you regain access to your accounts if your password is compromised.

## Protecting Yourself in the Age of AI

### Stay Informed
- Keep yourself educated about the latest developments in AI and how they may impact security threats. Understand how AI-driven tools can be used to impersonate people, manipulate information, and create deepfake content.

### Use Trusted Sources
- Only use trusted sources of information and software to avoid falling victim to AI-generated scams, phishing attacks, or malware.

## Be Aware of Scams

### Educate Yourself
- Learn about common scams, such as phishing emails, phone scams, and fake websites, so you can recognize and avoid them.

### Verify Information
- Always verify the legitimacy of emails, phone calls, or messages before taking any action, especially if they involve sensitive information or financial transactions. Be cautious about clicking on links, opening attachments, or sharing personal information.

## Learn to Use Technology Safely

### Update Software Regularly
- Keep your software and devices updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.

### Use Antivirus and Firewall
- Install and maintain antivirus software and a firewall to protect your devices from malware and unauthorized access.

### Secure Your Wi-Fi Network
- Secure your Wi-Fi network with a strong password and encryption, and disable remote administration features.

## Ask for Help

### Consult Experts
- When in doubt, consult experts or reliable sources like Google and ChatGPT to get answers to your security-related questions.
